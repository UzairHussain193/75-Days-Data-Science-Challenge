    "### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and computer programs. In Python, OOP allows us to create classes and objects, encapsulate data, and define behavior through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `Car` is a class that doesn't have any attributes or methods yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We use classes becuase:\n",
    "1. It helps in `code reusability` - means we can use the same class in different programs\n",
    "2. It helps in `code readability` - means we can understand the code easily\n",
    "3. It helps in `code maintenance` - means we can update the code easily\n",
    "4. It helps in `code testing` - means we can test the code easily\n",
    "5. It helps in `code debugging` - means we can debug the code easily\n",
    "6. It helps in `code scalability` - means we can scale the code easily\n",
    "7. It helps in `code security` - means we can secure the code easily\n",
    "8. It helps in `code optimization` - means we can optimize the code easily\n",
    "9. It helps in `code performance` - means we can improve the performance of the code easily\n",
    "10. It helps in `code documentation` - means we can document the code easily\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "Attributes are variables that belong to an object. They are defined within the constructor or directly in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "print(my_car.model)  # Output: Corolla\n",
    "print(my_car.year)  # Output: 2020\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `make`, `model`, and `year` are attributes of the `my_car` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of the objects created from the class. They can operate on the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine has started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine has stopped.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine has started.\n",
    "my_car.stop_engine()   # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine has stopped.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `start_engine` and `stop_engine` are methods that define the behavior of the `Car` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Example\n",
    "Combining all these concepts, let's create a more comprehensive example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.running = False\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        if not self.running:\n",
    "            self.running = True\n",
    "            print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine has started.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is already running.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop_engine(self):\n",
    "        if self.running:\n",
    "            self.running = False\n",
    "            print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine has stopped.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is already off.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Car Info: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of Car\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display car information\n",
    "my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car Info: 2020 Toyota Corolla\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start and stop the engine\n",
    "my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine has started.\n",
    "my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine is already running.\n",
    "my_car.stop_engine()   # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine has stopped.\n",
    "my_car.stop_engine()   # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine is already off.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have:\n",
    "- Defined a `Car` class with attributes `make`, `model`, `year`, and `running`.\n",
    "- Used the `__init__` constructor to initialize these attributes.\n",
    "- Defined methods `start_engine`, `stop_engine`, and `display_info` to operate on these attributes and provide behaviors for the `Car` objects."
