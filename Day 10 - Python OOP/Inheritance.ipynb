    "### Inheritance\n",
    "It is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a superclass or base class). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class inherits from another class, it gains access to the methods and attributes of the superclass. The subclass can also have its own additional methods and attributes or override methods from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple example to demonstrate inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superclass (Base Class):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Vehicle Info: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine has started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine has stopped.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subclass (Derived Class):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year, num_doors):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model, year)  # Call the constructor of the superclass\n",
    "        self.num_doors = num_doors\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        super().display_info()  # Call the method from the superclass\n",
    "        print(f\"Number of doors: {self.num_doors}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Superclass `Vehicle`:**\n",
    "   - Contains common attributes (`make`, `model`, `year`) and methods (`display_info`, `start_engine`, `stop_engine`) for all vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subclass `Car`:**\n",
    "   - Inherits from `Vehicle` using the syntax `class Car(Vehicle):`.\n",
    "   - Has an additional attribute `num_doors` specific to cars.\n",
    "   - Overrides the `display_info` method to include information about the number of doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an instance of the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call methods on the Car instance\n",
    "my_car.display_info()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Vehicle Info: 2020 Toyota Corolla\n",
    "# Number of doors: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car.start_engine()\n",
    "# Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine has started.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car.stop_engine()\n",
    "# Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine has stopped.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class, so it can use the `start_engine` and `stop_engine` methods directly.\n",
    "- The `Car` class has its own constructor that initializes `num_doors` in addition to the attributes inherited from `Vehicle`.\n",
    "- The `display_info` method in the `Car` class calls the `display_info` method of the `Vehicle` class using `super()`, then adds additional information specific to `Car`.\n"

    "### Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one base class. This can be done by specifying multiple base classes in the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Electric:\n",
    "    def charge_battery(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The battery is being charged.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class ElectricCar(Vehicle, Electric):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year, battery_capacity):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model, year)\n",
    "        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        super().display_info()\n",
    "        print(f\"Battery capacity: {self.battery_capacity} kWh\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of ElectricCar\n",
    "my_electric_car = ElectricCar(\"Tesla\", \"Model S\", 2021, 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call methods on the ElectricCar instance\n",
    "my_electric_car.display_info()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Vehicle Info: 2021 Tesla Model S\n",
    "# Battery capacity: 100 kWh\n",
    "\n",
    "my_electric_car.start_engine()\n",
    "# Output: The Tesla Model S's engine has started.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_electric_car.charge_battery()\n",
    "# Output: The battery is being charged.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `ElectricCar` inherits from both `Vehicle` and `Electric`.\n",
    "- It has access to methods from both base classes (`Vehicle` and `Electric`), allowing it to call `start_engine` from `Vehicle` and `charge_battery` from `Electric`.\n",
    "- The `display_info` method is overridden to include information about the battery capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchy. It can be used to create complex class structures while maintaining clean and maintainable code."
