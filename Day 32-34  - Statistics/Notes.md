### Statistics
**Definition:**
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides tools for making decisions based on data.

It is the science of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data.

**Example:**
A researcher collects data on the heights of 100 students in a school to determine the average height of the student population.

### Data
**Definition:**
Data refers to the raw facts and figures that are collected for analysis and used to make decisions. It can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (categorical).

**Example:**
The heights of the students (e.g., 150 cm, 160 cm, 170 cm) collected by the researcher are examples of quantitative data. The students' favorite subjects (e.g., Math, Science, English) are examples of qualitative data.

### Types of Statistics

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   **Definition:**
   Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and organizing data so it can be easily understood. It includes measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

   **Example:**
   If a teacher calculates the average score (mean) of a class on a test, finds the most common score (mode), and measures how spread out the scores are (standard deviation), they are using descriptive statistics.

2. **Inferential Statistics**
   **Definition:**
   Inferential statistics involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory to estimate population parameters and test hypotheses.

   **Example:**
   If a company surveys 200 customers about their satisfaction and uses the results to infer the satisfaction level of all its customers, they are using inferential statistics.

### Population
**Definition:**
A population is the entire group of individuals or items that are the subject of a statistical analysis. It includes all possible observations.

**Example:**
The population could be all the students in a particular school when studying their average height.

### Sample
**Definition:**
A sample is a subset of the population that is used to represent the population in a statistical analysis. It is selected because it is impractical to collect data from the entire population.

**Example:**
Selecting 100 students from the school to measure their heights, and using that data to estimate the average height of all students in the school, is working with a sample.

## Sampling techniques
1. Simple random Sampling
2. Stratefied Sampling
3. Systematic Sampling
4. Convenience Sampling

Sure, here is an explanation of various sampling techniques along with examples for each:

### 1. Simple Random Sampling
**Explanation:**
Simple random sampling is a technique where each member of a population has an equal chance of being selected. It is the most basic form of sampling and is often used when the population is homogeneous.

**Example:**
Imagine you have a list of 1,000 employees at a company, and you want to survey 100 of them about job satisfaction. You could use a random number generator to select 100 unique numbers between 1 and 1,000, and then survey the employees corresponding to those numbers on the list.

### 2. Stratified Sampling
**Explanation:**
Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups or strata that share similar characteristics, and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This ensures that each subgroup is adequately represented in the sample.

**Example:**
Consider a university with 10,000 students, divided into 4 strata based on their year (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). If you want a sample of 400 students, you could randomly select 100 students from each year group to ensure all classes are represented proportionately.

### 3. Systematic Sampling
**Explanation:**
Systematic sampling involves selecting every nth member of a population after a random start. This method is useful when a population list is available and is assumed to be ordered in a way that doesn't introduce bias.

**Example:**
If you have a list of 1,000 households in a city and want to sample 100 of them, you might start by randomly choosing a number between 1 and 10 (say 4), then select every 10th household thereafter (4, 14, 24, 34, ...).

### 4. Convenience Sampling
**Explanation:**
Convenience sampling involves selecting members of the population that are easiest to reach. This method is often used when time and resources are limited, but it may introduce bias because it doesn't represent the entire population.

**Example:**
A researcher standing outside a mall surveying passersby about their shopping habits is using convenience sampling. They choose respondents based on who is available and willing to participate at that location and time.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Random Sampling** | Every member has an equal chance of being selected.              | Randomly selecting 100 employees from a list of 1,000.     |
| **Stratified Sampling**     | Dividing the population into subgroups and sampling each group. | Selecting 100 students from each year in a university.     |
| **Systematic Sampling**     | Selecting every nth member of a population list.                | Choosing every 10th household from a list of 1,000.        |
| **Convenience Sampling**    | Selecting members that are easiest to reach.                    | Surveying shoppers at a mall.                              |
