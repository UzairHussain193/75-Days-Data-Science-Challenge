### 1. Statistics

**Definition:** Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It is used to make informed decisions based on data.

**Explanation:** Statistics involves various methods and tools to understand patterns and trends within data, enabling predictions and insights into various phenomena.

**Examples:** 
- Analyzing the average income of a population.
- Studying the effects of a new drug in clinical trials.

### 2. Data

**Definition:** Data are raw facts and figures collected for analysis. They can be qualitative or quantitative.

**Explanation:** Data are the foundation of statistical analysis, representing information that can be processed to extract meaningful insights.

**Examples:** 
- Test scores of students.
- Customer feedback on a product.

### 3. Types of Statistics

**Definition:** Statistics can be divided into two main types: Descriptive and Inferential.

#### 3.1 Descriptive Statistics

**Definition:** Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.

**Explanation:** It involves calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation to provide a summary of the data.

**Examples:** 
- Average test scores of a class.
- Median age of a group of people.

#### 3.2 Inferential Statistics

**Definition:** Inferential statistics make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data.

**Explanation:** It uses probability theory to draw conclusions about a larger population from a smaller sample.

**Examples:** 
- Predicting election results based on a poll.
- Estimating the average height of all students in a school based on a sample.

### 4. Population and Sample

**Population:**

**Definition:** The entire set of individuals or items of interest in a statistical study.

**Explanation:** It includes all members or elements under study.

**Example:** All students in a university.

**Sample:**

**Definition:** A subset of the population used to represent the entire group.

**Explanation:** It is selected to make inferences about the population.

**Example:** A group of 100 students selected from the university.

### 5. Sampling Techniques

**Definition:** Methods used to select samples from a population.

#### 5.1 Simple Random Sampling

**Definition:** Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

**Example:** Drawing names from a hat.

#### 5.2 Stratified Sampling

**Definition:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata), and samples are taken from each stratum.

**Example:** Dividing a population by gender and then randomly sampling from each group.

#### 5.3 Systematic Sampling

**Definition:** Every nth member of the population is selected.

**Example:** Selecting every 10th person on a list.

#### 5.4 Convenience Sampling

**Definition:** Samples are selected based on ease of access and availability.

**Example:** Surveying people in a shopping mall.

### 6. Variable

**Definition:** A characteristic or property that can take on different values.

**Explanation:** Variables represent data points that can vary among individuals or over time.

**Examples:** Age, height, income.

### 7. Types of Variables

**Definition:** Variables can be classified into two main types: Quantitative and Qualitative.

#### 7.1 Quantitative

**Definition:** Quantitative variables are numerical and can be measured.

##### 7.1.1 Discrete

**Definition:** Discrete variables are countable in a finite amount of time.

**Examples:** Number of students in a class, number of cars in a parking lot.

##### 7.1.2 Continuous

**Definition:** Continuous variables can take on any value within a given range.

**Examples:** Height of individuals, time taken to complete a task.

#### 7.2 Qualitative

**Definition:** Qualitative variables are descriptive and categorize individuals or items.

**Examples:** Gender, blood type, nationality.

### 8. Variable Measurement Scale

**Definition:** Different scales used to measure variables.

#### 8.1 Nominal Data

**Definition:** Data that can be categorized but not ordered.

**Examples:** Gender, eye color, ethnicity.

#### 8.2 Ordinal Data

**Definition:** Data that can be ordered but the differences between values are not meaningful.

**Examples:** Rankings, survey responses (e.g., satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied).

#### 8.3 Interval Data

**Definition:** Data with meaningful differences between values but no true zero point.

**Examples:** Temperature in Celsius, dates on a calendar.

#### 8.4 Ratio Data

**Definition:** Data with meaningful differences and a true zero point.

**Examples:** Weight, height, age.

### 9. Frequency Distribution

**Definition:** A summary of how often each value occurs in a dataset.

#### 9.1 Bar Chart

**Definition:** A chart with rectangular bars representing the frequency of different categories.

**Examples:** Showing the number of students in different grade levels.

#### 9.2 Histogram

**Definition:** A chart with bars representing the frequency of numerical data intervals.

**Examples:** Showing the distribution of test scores.
