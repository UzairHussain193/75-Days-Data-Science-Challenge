## Views
- Views is a virtual table based on the result set of an Sql query.
- A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
- we want to take a look on specific columns for specific research from different tables, so we can create a view that have multiple columns from different tables, which are needed, it's just a blueprint.
