## Python

### Basics
Learning the fundamentals of Python programming including syntax, variables, and data types.

### Loops and Control Structures
Understanding loops (`for`, `while`) and control structures (`if-else`, `elif`) for decision making and iteration.

### Comparison Operators
Using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) to compare values.

### Inbuilt Structures and Number Methods
Exploring Python's inbuilt data structures like strings, and various methods for manipulating numbers.

### Lists and Functions
Learning about lists, list comprehensions, and defining functions in Python.

### Sets, Dictionary, Tuples
Working with sets, dictionaries, and tuples for storing and managing collections of data.

### Numpy Arrays
Using NumPy for numerical computations and handling large datasets with array operations.

## Statistics
Gaining an understanding of basic statistical concepts, measures, and their application in data science.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Feature Engineering
Techniques and methods for transforming raw data into meaningful features for machine learning models.

## Databases

### MySQL
Learning how to use MySQL for managing and querying relational databases.

## Machine Learning
Introduction to machine learning concepts, algorithms, and their implementation using Python libraries like Scikit-learn.

## Deep Learning
Exploring deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch to build and train neural networks.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Techniques for processing and analyzing textual data, including tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.

## Frameworks for Production Deployment

### Flask
Using Flask to create and deploy web applications and APIs.

### BentoML
Building, packaging, and deploying machine learning models with BentoML.

### MLflow
Tracking and managing machine learning experiments and deployments with MLflow.

## MLOps
Implementing MLOps practices to streamline the deployment and monitoring of machine learning models in production.

## Data Science Projects
Applying the learned concepts and techniques to real-world data science projects, from data collection to model deployment.
